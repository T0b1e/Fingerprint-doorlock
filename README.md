# Fingerprint-doorlock
Fingerprint doorlock Arduino project make from Fingerprint sensor and Solenoid door lock

![image](docs/IMG_5542.HEIC)
## Main Idea
Create Doorlock that uses Fingerprint sensor and has less money than another device and Easy way to use

## Property
- Arduino UNO
- Fingerprint sensor
- Solinoid doorlock 12 volt
- PCB 
- Button
- Jumper Male-Female, Female-Female

## How it work
1. Scan finger on fingerprint sensor
2. waitting for find data
3. if you are user that register then The door will open

## Exmaple 

## In the future
1. Less material
2. Cheaper
